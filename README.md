# Naughts & Crosses: Guardians of the Galaxy Style

If you are always searching for the next adventure, then you will breath a sigh of relief upon signing up with Trekr.  Having the ability to search and share information on hikes in my area, or in a location which I plan to visit, is always limited and restricted to my own social network. With Trekr, I have the ability to create, share, and explore all the hiking data in the site's online community at any time!

_Description of Site Features below._



## Site Overview
- Ever found it difficult to search and share good hiking beta on routes and experiences on-trail?
- Trekr provides a single pane of glass experience through which friends, family, and fellow members of the hiking community can create, share, and review hiking route info and experiences!
- With a suite of interactive maps and map-drawing tools, hikers can now create hikes which all other Trekr's can review! With commenting functionality, all members can exchange feedback & location-specific 'tips' for each other to view as well!


## Primary Site Features

- 1) Creating a Hike: Give your hike a name & summary description. Then, utilize the drawing tools available on the 'create hike' page's map to plot a line of all the journey's waypoints (latitude & longitude). Upon submission all will be saved and added for the rest of the Trekr users to view and comment on from the 'Search Hikes Page'.

- 2) Once on the your hike's Individual 'Show' Page, you & other Trekr users can add Marker's to the map, specifying a any tip you want for other Trekr's to keep an eye out for before they try out your hiking path. (Ex: Trail Hazard Warning, Viewpoint, etc.)

- 3) Feel free to leave a comment on any Trekr's 'Show' Page to contribute to the online community of hikers.

- 4) Toggle between the Terrain and Satellite views on the 'Search (All) Hikes' & Individual Hike 'Show' Page.
